<p>Howdy! We are the folks behind a variety of services designed to allow anyone
to be able to analyze any chess game for suspected cheating.

All the games you submit are becoming part of public domain and can be found, viewed and analyzed by
other users.</p>

<p>We also collect some information automatically:
like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, including the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Services.
We collect information about your usage of our Services. For example, we record all the game submissions for analysis.</p>
